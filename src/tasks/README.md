- Task Folder Naming Convention : _task-n-taskname.(n is the task number)_  ex: task-1-data-analysis, task-2-model-deployment etc.
- All Task folder names should be in chronologial order (from 1 to n)
- All Task folders should have a README.md file with task Details and task goals along with an info table containing all code/notebook files with their links and information
